# PAC-AGAIN: Pacman revisited by Rafael Odon (odon.rafael@gmail.com)

A Pacman variation written in pure HTML5 Canvas/Javascript (ES5) for learning purposes.

No sprite images are loaded, all the visual elements are drawn using the JavaScript graphic API.

No external lib is included. All the motion tween and animations were calculated and programmed from scratch.

Be careful, may contain non-optimized and under-construction code. :'(
