# PAC-AGAIN: Pacman revisited by Rafael Odon (odon.rafael@gmail.com)

A Pacman variation written in pure HTML5 Canvas/Javascript (ES5) for learning purposes.

No external lib is included. All the motion tween and animations were calculated and programmed from scratch.

No sprite images are loaded, all the visual elements are drawn using the JavaScript graphic API.

Be careful, may contain non-optimized and under-construction code. :'(

## About the game
* The very basic thing is to guide Pac trough the grid and collect all the pills in each level.
* As the levels goes by, the difficulty level increases
* Dumb Ghosts may be present in the level. They won't chase Pac, but you'd better not touch them.
* If you get somewhere closer to a Chaser Ghost, it will sure run after you, until you get him distracted again.
* In some levels, an extra-life may become avaiable before you eat the last pill. 
* When present, nibbles can be eaten to make Pac body increase like a worm. That will give you an advantage in case a Ghost hits you, since instead of loosing a life, you'll just loose that piece of worm body. 
* Some levels have doors blocking parts of the map. Find the corresponding trigger and walk over it to unlock the door.

## Future features:
* Spit fire/hadouken to kill ghosts
* Bomber-man mashup: collect and drop bombs to break some tiles and open passages.
* A map editor
